## About the Project
This project is a digital adaptation of the game "Wavelength," created for personal, educational, and non-commercial use. It is designed to be accessible for both Italian and English-speaking users. The game is heavily inspired by the original "Wavelength" game, and I've added my own twist with a "reverse mode" feature. Furthermore, users can choose between various decks to play with and even develop their own.

All images on the site are generated by DallE, from OpenAI. The whole site took me 3 days to develop. It is usable on mobile devices.

The original "Wavelength" is developed by [CMYK](https://www.cmyk.games/). For more information about the original game, visit its [official website](https://www.wavelength.zone/) and [press kit](https://www.wavelength.zone/presskit).

## Game Description
"Wavelength" is a party game where players attempt to read each other's minds. The game involves a spectrum with two opposite ends representing contrasting concepts. The players are divided in two teams. In turns, one player (said "psychic") spins the wheel using the "Spin!" button to set a target on this spectrum. This same player then gives a clue to help their team guess the target's location, the clue needs to be at maximum of 5 words and no more explanations are allowed. The opposite team will then guess if the target was more on the right or more on the left of the current team guess.

### Features
- **Spin the Wheel**: Use the "Spin!" button to randomly set the target on the spectrum.
- **Cover Mechanism**: Open or close the cover with the "Coperho" button.
- **Scale Selection**: Extract scales using the "Estra Scalla" button.
- **Move the indicator**: Move the target indicator with the arrow keys.
- **Scoring**: The target has blue for 4 points, orange for 3 points, and yellow for 2 points. If the current team did not place the indicator on the blue portion, the opposite team gets 1 point if they correctly assessed that the blue was more on the right/left of the current team guess.
- **Customizable Decks and Settings**: Choose decks and languages, and adjust game settings using the button in the top right corner.
- **Reverse Mode**: Change mode with the button on the top left corner: A unique mode where the suggestion is set before knowing the target. Teams guess the scale among various options.

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**: Select a deck and language, and configure game settings.
2. **Spin the Wheel**: Click "Spin!" to set a target on the spectrum.
3. **Giving a Clue**: The "psychic" gives a clue related to the hidden target.
4. **Guessing the Target**: The team discusses and guesses the target's location by moving the indicator with the arrow keys.
5. **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on how close the guess is to the target.
6. **Reverse Mode**: Discuss and set a suggestion before knowing the target value. The "psychic" player draws a scale and set the target publicly. The team then guesses the scale from multiple options.
